# Checkbox.ai Tech Challenge

## Context

You’ve been assigned to a team working on building out a new task management software. Over the course of a few days, many customer interviews & user mapping flows, you and your product manager arrive together at the following set of user stories.

- User should be able to create a new task, including the following fields (Required)
  - Name
  - Description
  - Due date
- User should be able to view all tasks created in a list view, showing all the following details (Required)
  - Name
  - Description
  - Due date
  - Create date
  - Status
    - Not urgent
    - Due soon (Due date is within 7 days)
    - Overdue
- User should be able to edit task name, description and due date (Required)
- User should be able to sort by due date or create date (Should have)
- User should be able to search based on task name (Should have)

You also discussed that one of the key risks would be that there may be huge volumes of tasks created, in the 10s of 1000s, and wanted to ensure that the system would still be performant for users.

## Your task

- Create a working solution that showcases the above required user stories & addresses the risk identified
- Please describe how you will approach the should have user stories.
- Please articulate and explain any design decisions you made in your readme.
- Feel free to use any libraries to help you.
- Don’t worry too much about styling it perfectly!
- List any further improvements to your code that you would’ve made if you had time

## Technology stack

If possible, we would like to see your experience and proficiency with our tech stack, that would be a bonus, but it is not required.

- React
- NodeJS (Express)
- Typescript
- Golang
- Postgres
- Docker

## What we’ll be looking for

We’ll be looking at this as a demonstration of the type of code you would be comfortable pushing to a large, mature production codebase that many others are also working on, so this is an opportunity for you to showcase the following:

- Clean, manageable & well structured code
- Production quality code
- Git maturity. Please show your full git commit history (rather than pushing everything up in one commit).
- Understanding & effective implementation of best practices around the libraries used
- Understanding & effective implementation of best practices around general programming paradigms
- How you addressed (or planned to address) the risks highlighted
- Demonstrated understanding of other tasks you would do if you had time & how you would implement them
